# Website Test Yuh

## Project Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce website focused on showcasing a collection of men's clothing. The website includes various pages such as the homepage, product pages, a shopping cart, and a contact page.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **menjeans.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the men's collection page, including a section for product cards that will be dynamically populated with data from a CSV file.
  
- **javascript.js**: Contains JavaScript code that reads the CSV file and dynamically populates the product cards in menjeans.html with product data.

- **test.csv**: Contains product data in CSV format, including fields such as ID, Title, Price, Colors, Description, and Image URL. This data will be parsed and used to populate the product cards.

- **minimalist.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the website, which are used to style the product cards and other elements on the page.

- **winkelwagen.html**: Represents the shopping cart page of the website.

- **contact.html**: Represents the contact page of the website.

- **index.html**: The homepage of the website.

- **heren.html**: Represents the men's collection page, similar to menjeans.html.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Open `menjeans.html` in a web browser to view the men's collection page.
4. Ensure that the `test.csv` file is correctly formatted and located in the project directory for the JavaScript to read the product data.

## Usage
- The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.
- Product cards on the men's collection page will be populated with data from the CSV file, allowing for easy updates to product information without modifying the HTML structure directly.

## Future Improvements
- Implement a backend to manage product data dynamically.
- Add user authentication for a personalized shopping experience.
- Enhance the styling and layout for better user engagement.
